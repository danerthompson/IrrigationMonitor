# IrrigationMonitor

This code will serve to control an ESP32 and SIM-7000G modem in order to monitor the location of a center pivot irrigation sprinkler.

The IrrigationMonitor folder contains the code for the ESP32. The IrrigationMonitorWebServer contains the Javascript and HTML for the NodeJS web server.
